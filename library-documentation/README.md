## Accenture Automation Test Library (aATL)



**A series of loosely coupled java libraries with code collected from multiple test projects.** 

**The aim is to allow new test projects to re-use these libraries and to focus primarily on developing the test cases and test code itself rather than the typical heavy upfront investment in framework creation.**

**The libraries include support for:**

- api testing

- browser testing
- mobile app testing
- output reporting
- database connectivity
- ssh connectivity and running backend server commands
- test data factory
- interface mocking
- parallel test execution
- jira integration

A project can use all or some of the libraries according to its test requirement (only the common library must always be used).  The libraries are available as a set of version controlled jars which can be simply imported into a test project or the source code can be cloned and adapted locally for the project as needed.

A central support team is available to assist projects in getting started and for ongoing collaboration on enhancing and growing the libraries.  

The libraries are approved as open source by Accenture legal and leadership for re-use on any client engagement.  

The links below provide readme guides for each individual library.
